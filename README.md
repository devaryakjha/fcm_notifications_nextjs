# FCM with Next.js

This project demonstrates how to use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) with Next.js. The UI is minimal and displays a table that shows the index, from, title, body, and data properties of the messages received.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the dependencies by running `bun install`.
3. Create a Firebase project and enable FCM.
4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.development.local` and add you firebase configuration to it.
5. Run the development server by running `bun run dev`.
6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can view the messages received by opening the browser console. The table on the page will also display the messages.
